# Work Tracker

## Snapshot (2026-02-20)

- Branch: `main`
- Active command surface: `configure`, `sign`, `status`
- Canonical spec: `/Users/jean/src/github.com/openawa/openawa/docs/cli-spec.md`
- Workflow policy: `/Users/jean/src/github.com/openawa/openawa/AGENTS.md`

Latest validation on this machine (2026-03-06):

- `pnpm install` -> pass
- `pnpm run check` -> pass
- `pnpm run build` -> pass
- `pnpm run test` -> pass (`23 passed / 0 failed`)
- `pnpm run test:e2e` -> pass (`1 passed / 0 failed`, ~25s)

## Key Insights (Precall Model)

- Configure can be frictionless and still safe by using Porto precalls first (`wallet_grantPermissions`) and deferring activation to first real send.
- Relay key reads (`wallet_getKeys`) are reliable for active onchain permissions, but they do not represent all pending precall intent.
- Human UX needs explicit state, so configure now reports one of:
  - `active_onchain`
  - `pending_activation`
- Idempotency with precalls requires local pending-state memory to avoid re-queuing the same permission envelope on rerun.
- If intent changes before activation, queueing a newer precall is acceptable, but configure must state that activation is still pending.

## Key Insights (Multichain Permission Model)

- Porto `wallet_connect` response permissions each have `chainId?: number` (confirmed from `rpc.d.ts` and live responses).
- Porto returns **2 entries** per permission per response. The dialog server (`id.porto.sh`) returns both the relay's currently stored key AND the newly requested key in `capabilities.permissions`. Porto has no persistent client-side state between CLI runs (`Storage.memory()` in Node.js), so both entries originate server-side.
  - Entry 1 = relay's stored representation: `token: "0x0000..."` for native, includes fee-relay call `0x36a7...`, **old spend amounts** (on-chain update is async/pending so stored amounts are stale).
  - Entry 2 = newly requested key: `token: null` for native, just the requested calls, **new spend amounts** after `resolvePermissions`.
  - Both share the same `chainId`, `id`, and `expiry` (the new expiry from this grant).
- In multi-chain responses, Porto returns entries for ALL chains the key has active permissions on, each tagged with the correct `chainId`.
- `findGrantedPermission` filters by `publicKey`, then by `chainId`, then picks the **last** entry when expiries are equal (`>=` not `>`) to get entry 2 (newly requested, correct permissions) not entry 1 (relay-stored, stale).
- Spend limits are **per-chain** (enforced by the per-chain smart contract); the relay stores `HashMap<ChainId, Vec<AuthorizeKeyResponse>>`. Entry 1 for a new chain echoes whatever the relay last stored for that key globally — stale data from a prior chain's grant.
- The native spend value in entry 2 is larger than what you request: `resolvePermissions` in Porto merges the native `feeToken.limit` into the native `spend` entry (user spend + fee cap = stored native limit).
- Vitest `pretty-format` serializes plain object keys ALPHABETICALLY: `"11155420"` sorts before `"84532"` in inline snapshots.

## Known Upstream Issues

### Relay: `wallet_getKeys` leaks session keys cross-chain for pre-delegation accounts

- **Root cause**: `upgradeAccount` stores a `CreatableAccount` in the `accounts` table keyed by address only (no chain_id). When `wallet_getKeys` is called for a chain where the account isn't yet delegated, `get_keys_for_chain` falls back to `read_account` and returns ALL keys — including session keys that were only granted on the original chain.
- **Fix authored** (not yet merged): `~/src/github.com/ithacaxyz/relay` — added `chain_id: Option<u64>` to `CreatableAccount`, filter to admin-only keys in the fallback when chain doesn't match. Files: `src/types/storage.rs`, `src/rpc/relay.rs`, `tests/e2e/cases/keys.rs`, `tests/storage/roundtrip.rs`.
- **Agent-wallet impact**: Low. `getActivePermissions` already passes `chainIds: [chain.id]` and filters by `role === 'normal'` + public key match, so it won't misuse leaked keys. Worst case: `status` could show a permission as present on a chain where it's only pending via precall.

## Now

- Expand colocated unit coverage under `src/**` (ongoing).
- Decide CI strategy for live passkey e2e (scheduled/manual vs per-PR).
- Bootstrap npm trusted publishing and cut the first public npm release.

## Next

- Move Secure Enclave opaque handle storage from config into keychain item.
- Introduce account profile model with alias + default selection.

## Later

- Remote-admin setup (out-of-band admin ceremony from separate device).
- Multi-account aliases and default profile ergonomics.
- Evaluate additional backend adapters after Porto-first UX stabilizes.

## Done (Recent)

- Added tag-driven npm release automation with `release-it`, keeping version bumps out of committed source and documenting a manual bootstrap-tag path.
- Declared Node.js 22 as the minimum supported runtime in `package.json` and switched CI `setup-node` to read the version from `package.json`.
- Added Husky and lint-staged pre-commit hooks so staged JS/TS files are auto-fixed with Oxlint and formatted with Oxfmt before commit.
- Adopted `oxfmt` and `oxlint`, added `pnpm run check`, and added CI coverage for format/lint/typecheck plus build and unit test.
- Updated `AGENTS.md` to require Conventional Commit titles and to explicitly self-improve the workflow notes when durable repo-specific learnings emerge.
- Switched the chipkey npm dependency/import from `@jeanregisser/chipkey` to `@chipkey/cli`.
- Switched the repo package manager from npm to pnpm and replaced `package-lock.json` with `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
- Upgraded `incur` from `0.1.17` to `0.2.2` and revalidated `typecheck`, `test`, and `test:e2e`.
- Aligned caret lower bounds in `package.json` to the current resolved versions for direct deps, except `@types/node`.
- Switched `porto` from an exact version spec to a caret range for consistency with the direct dependency policy.
- Removed unused `@vitest/browser-playwright`; the repo's e2e flow uses plain Vitest plus direct `playwright` APIs.
- Updated configure funding detection to check balances across all Porto-supported fee tokens and switched fee-token discovery to Porto SDK `RelayActions.getCapabilities`.
- Reduced the README local key management section to a single linked sentence pointing at `chipkey` and `@chipkey/cli`.
